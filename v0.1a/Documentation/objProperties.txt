-- Creating an instance --
To create an instance of an object, a single function is called.

Example: createObject('ID goes here');

-- Logic behind variables
This will import the property data along with the instances
individual ID into the 'loadedObjs' array.

The individual ID is then stored as a key with the objects listed
index (within the loadedObjs array) as its respective value.

This allows the object to obtain a unique ID in a short iterable
dictionary whilst also retaining an efficient searching algorithm.

This method also allows for multiple iterable new instances i.e.
map loading.

-- Extra properties
As some objects require more properties than others there are
optable values for these properties stored in the JSON.

Example : if positional data is not required then setting value
	to 0 will be viewed as an unrequired input when creating
	the object itself.

If extra properties are required then they are processed in an args
array passed to the createObject function.

Example : createObject('ID goes here', ['position:15,18','hp:57']);
(if no property data is required then the arg is not required)

If required property data is not passed to the function then a
default value of 0 is used.
